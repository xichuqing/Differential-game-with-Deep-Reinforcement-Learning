Use Multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) in Pytorch to solve out the Feedback NE in a differential game model for two players: government and ZEV manufacturer, aiming to find the best policy strategy for the government.

I merge all the code snippets into one notebook. If you want to run it, seperate them into different py files. The snippet 'main' is the code contains execution function and the hyperparameters settings using ArgumentParser function.
